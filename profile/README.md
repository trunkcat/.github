Trunkcat Studios is a two-person independent game development team creating open-source games and tools.
We build stuff for ourselves, so we build it carefully, and we develop them openly. We also drop some projects half-way.

### Projects

- [TKM Odessey](https://github.com/trunkcat/tkm-odessey-0): Wander around [TKM College of Engineering](https://tkmce.ac.in) like Mario.
- [Anyone Can Cook](https://github.com/trunkcat/coooked): Cooking Fever like Restaurant game for Android (pretty basic).
- [Fullplate](https://github.com/trunkcat/fullplate): 2nd attempt at making a cooking fever game for our course (online account sync!).
- [Fixtures](https://github.com/trunkcat/fixtures): A free-to-use tournament manager application that doesn't suck (it currently does tho).

### Technologies and Tools

- [Godot](https://godotengine.org/): GDScript
- [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com/): Java
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org): JavaScript, TypeScript, Svelte, React
